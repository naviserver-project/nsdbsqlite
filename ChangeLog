    change from row collection to row retrieval
    
    Rather than collecting all the rows up front at the time of the
    select, retrieve them one at a time inside GetRow.  This is a
    much more natural approach anyway.

    change from exec to explicit prepare/step
    
    sqlite3_exec is a convenience routine.  It simplifies some things while
    hiding things best exposed.  In this case, it seems better to separate
    the allocation of columns from the opaque callback.  Original motivation
    was to fix the bug whereby a select returning 0 rows was assumed to be dml.

    include sqlite 3.7.15 amalgamation
    
    Include sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h directly in the repository, rather
    than relying on them being already installed on a system.  This follows
    advice from the sqlite community, in order to avoid C api changes from
    installing a new binary breaking an existing binary.

    initialise statement to NULL in DbOpen
    
    if the DbHandle was not initialized to all zeroes (which is not guaranteed),
    then cancelling before any query is run (i.e., just allocating a handle)
    will segfault
